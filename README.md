# TicTacToe
Play tic tac toe in the command line like it's 1984!

Put all the .py files in a folder and enter "python TicTacToe.py" to play.

There are 3 modes for the computer move selection:
- Random: the computer picks a random valid move
- Casual: the coputer picks a random move unless it can block the human from winning or can play a winning move
- Smart: the computer will not allow the human to win

Show the kids in your life what it was like to play games back in the day. The 5-year-old in my life likes random mode, while the 7-year-old prefers casual.
