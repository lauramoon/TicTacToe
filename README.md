# TicTacToe
Play tic tac toe in the command line like it's 1984!

Note: trying to figure out why Visual Studio only uploaded the git files and not the whole solution. The whole thing will be up shortly, hopefully...

Enter 'python TicTacToe.py' in the comand line to play.

There are 3 modes for the computer move selection:
- Random: the computer picks a random valid move
- Casual: the coputer picks a random move unless it can block the human from winning or can play a winning move
- Smart: the computer will not allow the human to win

Show the kids in your life what it was like to play games back in the day.
